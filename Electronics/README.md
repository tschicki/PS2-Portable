# PCB Outputs

This directory contains all the PCB projects. You will find the Gerber files in the respective *Gerber/* folders. The BOM is in ibom format and can be found in the *BOM/* folders where applicable. For very simple PCBs like the gamepad flex PCBs you will find the needed components in Part 5 of the project documentation.

If you need the BOM in CSV format, you can open the ibom files and export the content as CSV.
