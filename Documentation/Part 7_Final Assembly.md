# Part 7: Final Assembly of the Portable
This part of the assembly documentation will describe how to assemble the full portable PS2.

## Recommended Tools:
- Scalpel or similar
- Tweezers
- Tool for M1.6 heat set inserts
- Screw driver kit with at least a T5 bit

## Recommended Materials:
- Glue (epoxy preferred)
- Double-sided tape

## Mechanical Assembly

1. Press the *Nintendo Switch Lite Fan* (REF1000) onto the *PS2 Heatsink* (REF3000). It's a tight fit the first time you do it, and doing it before the assembly puts less mechanical stress on the mainboard.

1. Mount the *MemoryCard Flex* (REF4003) in the *MemoryCard Cover* (REF2014):

    <img src="assets/Memcard_Flex_3.jpg" width="400">

2. Insert the resulting subassembly in the *PS2 Heatsink*, take care that the *MemoryCard Flex* is fully seated. Then insert 4 screws M1.6x5mm (REF1007).

4. Cut a 18x18mm piece of 1mm thick thermal pad (REF1023). Cut a 30x30mm, 4x4mm and a 4x11mm piece of 0.5mm thermal pad (REF1022).

5. Stick the 30x30mm thermal pad onto the EE, the 18x18mm on the GS, the 4x4mm pad on the BQ25792 and the 4x11mm pad on the three charge FETs as shown below, connect the *MemoryCard Flex* to the *PS2 Mainboard*.

6. Close the resulting assembly like a book.

7. Add the *R1-L1 Bar* (REF2010), *Lower Display Mount* (REF2009), left & right gamepad subassembly (manufactured in [Part 5](https://github.com/tschicki/PS2-Portable/blob/main/Documentation/Part%205_Gamepad%20Subassemblies.md)) and mount them the following way:
    - First insert and tigthen the 4 M1.6x5mm screws (REF1007) circled in purple
    - Then tighten the 11 M1.6x5mm screws (REF1007) circled in red.
    - Manage the battery wires roughly to fit below the *R1-L1 Bar* and plug them into the mainboard. 
    - Insert the *R1-L1 Bar* and fasten it with 4 countersunk M1.6x6mm screws (REF1008) circled in green. Make sure to guide the battery wires of the right gamepad through the intended channels of the *R1-L1 Bar* before tightening its screws.

8. Insert the *Gamepad Flex Left* (REF4004) and *Gamepad Flex Right* (REF4005) and the battery connectors, if not done already.

9. Insert the left and right speaker connectors and connect the 4-pin FFC of the fan to the *PS2 Mainboard*. The fan FFC can be a bit subborn, use tweezers. Do not forget to close the latch of the fan connector.

12. Install 15x M1.6 threaded inserts (REF1014) into the *PS2 Main Housing Top* (REF2000). Push them in to slightly below the surface and then remove any protruding plastic with a scalpel. Make sure the surfaces are flush, otherwise the portable will not close correctly.  

    <img src="assets/Front_Shell_Inserts.JPG" width="641">
13. Adhere the two *Speaker Dust Covers* (REF1020) to the inside of the speaker holes on the *PS2 Main Housing Top*.  

    <img src="assets/Speaker_Cover.JPG" width="641">

14. Adhere the double-sided adhesive tape (REF1021) to the flat side of the *Screen Lens Frame*. Make sure there is no gap, as this mainly serves as dust-protection.

15. Remove the protective film of the *Nintendo 3DS XL Screen Lens* (REF1015) and adhere it into the *Screen Lens Frame*, to the side with the protruding feature of the exact same size as the screen lens. The alignment between the two parts is critical, make sure the screen lens is not shifted or rotated!

16. Remove the protective films of the *5 inch DPI display* (REF1003) and the double-sided adhesive on the *Screen Lens Frame*. Without getting any dust between them, align the *Screen Lens Frame* to the lower left corner of the display and join them. Both **must** be aligned on the left, right and lower edges. Again, the alignment between the two parts is key, so take your time and do it right!

14. Adhere the now created display subassembly to the *PS2 Main Housing Top* from the inside. If it needs to be permanent, use epoxy. I personally like to use Tesa 5157, then you can reuse the display subassembly in case you want to swap housings. Apply the tape / glue on the left, right and bottom lips of the *Screen Lens Frame* and press it into the *PS2 Main Housing Top*. Take care to first insert the upper edge of the display subassembly into the respective groove of the *PS2 Main Housing Top*, then leverage the subassembly into position.

16. Insert the *PLP1-100-FD Light Pipe* (REF1001) into the hole above the LED on the right gamepad. The longer side of it must face towards the outside.  

    <img src="assets/Light_Pipe_Install.JPG" width="641">
17. The power button (REF1012) will need some rework in order to fit - the actuator needs to be cut off using a scalpel. The start and select buttons may also need a slightly shortened actuator, but far less than the power button.

    <img src="assets/Start_Sel_Rework.JPG" height="300">
17. Insert all buttons into the inner skeleton and lift the *PS2 Main Housing Top* onto it from above. Insert the 40-pin flex cable of the *5 inch DPI display* (REF1003). Close the connector by gently pushing both left and right tabs into the connector at the same time.
Then move the *PS2 Main Housing Top* into position and do a quick check whether the light pipe and all buttons are in their cutouts.

18. Flip the assembly around; insert and tighten 13 M1.6x5mm screws (REF1007) in the locations marked below. Work your way from the center to the outside.

19. Insert and tighten 2 M1.6x6mm screws in the following locations:  

    <img src="assets/Front_Half_Assembly_2.JPG" width="641">
20. Test whether all buttons are pressable and feel good. The 3D printed parts may need some more rework if this is not the case.
21. Adhere the *Backside Vent Cover* (REF2014) to the *PS2 Main Housing Bot* (REF2001) using some glue.  

    <img src="assets/Vent_Cover.JPG" width="641">
22. Insert the *21000 Batteries* (REF1006) with **COORECT POLARITY**  

    <img src="assets/Battery_Insertion.JPG" width="641">
22. Seat the *PS2 Main Housing Bot* on the assembly and mount it using 10x M1.6x5mm screws (REF1007). Be careful to not pinch the *MemoryCard Flex* while closing the housing!  

    <img src="assets/Housing_Assembly.JPG" width="641">
23. The portable will not turn on right after assembly. Plug a charger, the LED will come on and then blink red/blue. This will force the battery protector to enable power, now the portable can be powered on by long-pressing the power button.

# End
The PS2 portable is now fully assembled! It's a good point now to read through the general usage tips in [Part 9](https://github.com/tschicki/PS2-Portable/blob/main/Documentation/Part%209_User%20Guide.md).
It is also highly recommended to build some accessories for the portable (see [Part 8](https://github.com/tschicki/PS2-Portable/blob/main/Documentation/Part%208_Accessories%20Assembly.md)):
- uSD2PSX - A must, if you want to play games on your portable!
- Travel case - Adds a layer of protection to your PS2 portable, if you like to carry it in your backpack!
- Display Stand - Quite handy for charging and perfect to display your portable when you're not using it!
