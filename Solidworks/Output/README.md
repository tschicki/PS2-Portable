# Mechanical Part Outputs

In here you will find the STEP and STL exports of all mechanical parts to 3D print / CNC. 

Please ignore the *./Output Assembly* folder, it contains the assembly file and all respective component bodies for me to easily export all files at once. In case you modify any parts in the working assembly under *./Solidworks/PS2_Assembly.SLDASM*, the respective parts in the export assembly should update automatically.
To export all models, open the assembly *./Output Assembly/Export.SLDASM* and save as either STEP or STL - make sure that you select to export the parts of the assembly individually in the options before saving.
